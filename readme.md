## Goal of this repository

The goal of this repository is to create a hands-on course/primer on python, given the proficiency of LLM's (making code a breeze)

Therefore, the learning goals will be to:

- Begin with the end in mind: Showcase different applications and ideas on Python. How do you use Python? What possible ideas can we give on the use? 
- Deliver learning during the case. Based on the case presented, get the basic ideas and structures in python and how to identify these.
- Learn your way through 'complex' code. As oppsoed to building your own code, you will be presented with larger snippets from the get-go. Have templates to shw how to fix/use tuff.
- Don t be bothered with IDE setup: Use databricks or google colab to get started, so ramp up is easy.

It is by no means the ultimate or best guide for learning python, but a good stater to help navigate the waters 

The idea is to create a basic reporsitory that can be run on databricks, google colab or another notebook service.
